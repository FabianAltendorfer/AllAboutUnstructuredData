*last updated June 15, 2022*

These license terms and conditions (“**Terms**”) are an agreement between you and your affiliates (collectively, “**you**”) and Microsoft Corporation or one of its affiliates (collectively, “**Microsoft**”). “**Affiliate**” means any legal entity that owns, is owned by, or is commonly owned with a party. “**Own**” means having more than 50% ownership or the right to direct the management of the entity.

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

These Terms apply to the use of any software provided by Microsoft that is used in or otherwise supports Microsoft’s Digital Evidence products and services ("**Software**"). The Software is comprised of the out-of-the-box and customized components and code packages identified in Exhibit A to these Terms, including Microsoft technologies that are used in or derived from the following Microsoft products and services, which are licensed under separate terms (collectively, “**Microsoft Products and Services**”), and third party (non-Microsoft) components or code (“**Third Party Components**”):

- Microsoft 365
- Microsoft Azure Services

In addition to complying with these Terms, to the extent that the Software includes components or code used in or derived from one or more of the Microsoft Products and Services, you must also comply with the [Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/) for the relevant Microsoft Products and Services. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms do not grant you a license or other right to use Microsoft Products and Services and that the right to access and use any Microsoft Products and Services are governed by the Product Terms applicable to the relevant Microsoft Product and Services. You also acknowledge and agree that your rights to access and use the Software are governed solely by this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will serve to supersede, amend, or modify any terms in the Product Terms for any relevant Microsoft Products and Services, or terminate any Product Terms for any relevant Microsoft Products and Services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Product Terms for the Microsoft Products and Services, these Terms will control.

Additionally, in addition to complying with these Terms, to the extent that the Software includes Third Party Components which are governed by an open-source license (“**Open-Source Components**”), as identified in Exhibit A-1 to these Terms, you must also comply with the terms of the open-source license, applicable to such Open-Source Components. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and an open-source license applicable to an Open-Source Component, the more restrictive provision will control.

Subject to the terms and restrictions set forth in these Terms, Microsoft grants you a nonexclusive, royalty-free right to access and use the Software in the Approved Countries (as defined below) for your internal use only. By accessing this Software, you represent and warrant that you will only use Microsoft Products and Services subject to and in accordance with the Product Terms applicable to such Microsoft Products and Services and that you will only use the Open-Source Components subject to the applicable open-source license(s) governing such Open-Source Components. You may <u>**not**</u> sublicense your rights to access and use the Software, and you may <u>**not**</u> distribute or in any way make available the Software or any use of it to any third parties (except to your affiliates and to vendors to perform work on your behalf) through distribution, network access, service agreement, lease, rental, or otherwise. This license does not purport to express any claim of ownership over data you may have shared with Microsoft in the creation of the Software. Unless applicable law gives you more rights, Microsoft reserves all other rights not expressly granted herein, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.  

The Software and any associated documentation will be made available by Microsoft through a private repository on GitHub (“**Repository**”). You acknowledge that access to the Repository is by invitation only and restricted to customers that are citizens of or domiciled in the countries identified in Exhibit B to these Terms, which list of countries may be amended from time to time at Microsoft’s sole discretion (collectively, “**Approved Countries**”). By accessing the Repository, you represent and warrant that you and any of your Affiliates that access and use the Software (i) are citizens of or domiciled in one or more of the Approved Countries; (ii) will not share any personal data with Microsoft in connection with your or your Affiliates’ use of the Software; and (iii) will not use the Software for purposes of processing biometric information or identifying or verifying individuals based on biometric information.

If you give feedback about the Software to Microsoft, you grant to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share, and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not provide any feedback that is subject to a license that would require Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties due to Microsoft including your feedback in such software or documentation.

Neither you nor your representatives may use the Software provided hereunder: (i) in a way prohibited by law, regulation, governmental order or decree; (ii) to violate the rights of others; (iii) to try to gain unauthorized access to or disrupt any service, device, data, account or network; (iv) to distribute spam or malware; (v) in a way that could harm Microsoft’s IT systems or impair anyone else’s use of them; (vi) in any application or situation where use of the Software could lead to the death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to physical or environmental damage; or (vii) to assist, encourage or enable anyone to do any of the above. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the Software, except and to the extent required by third-party licensing terms governing use of certain open-source components that may be included in the Software, or remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the Software.

Modern technologies may be used in new and innovative ways, and you must consider whether your specific use of these technologies is safe. The Software was developed for demonstration purposes only, and Microsoft does not provide technical support for the Software. To the extent you use the Software in production, you do so at your own risk. In addition to and without limiting the foregoing, the Software is not designed or intended to support any use in which a service interruption, defect, error, or other failure of the Software could result in the death or serious bodily injury of any person or in physical or environmental damage (collectively, “**High-Risk Use**”). Accordingly, you must ensure that, in the event of any interruption, defect, error, or other failure of the Software, the safety of people, property, and the environment are not reduced below a level that is reasonable, appropriate, and legal, whether in general or for a specific industry. Your use, including any High-Risk Use, of the Software is at your own risk.

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Microsoft harmless from and against all damages, costs and attorneys' fees in connection with any claims arising from your use of the Software, including any claims based in strict liability or that Microsoft was negligent in designing or providing the Software to you. The foregoing indemnification obligation is in addition to any other defense obligations set forth in any other licensing agreements you may have with Microsoft and is not subject to any limitation of, or exclusion from, liability contained in such agreements. Notwithstanding the above, if you are a U.S. federal government entity, the indemnification obligations set forth in this paragraph do not apply to you.

“**Confidential Information**” is non-public information that is designated “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential, including the terms of this agreement. For clarity, Microsoft’s Confidential Information includes the Software and any other information that Microsoft provides to you under these Terms.  Confidential Information does not include information that (a) becomes publicly available without a breach of these Terms, (b) the receiving party received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation, (c) is independently developed, or (d) is a comment or suggestion volunteered about the other party’s business, products or services.

Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s Confidential Information and will use the other party’s Confidential Information only for the purposes permitted under these Terms. Neither party will disclose that Confidential Information to third parties, except to its employees, Affiliates, contractors, advisors and consultants (“**Representatives**”) and then only on a need-to-know basis under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as these Terms. Each party remains responsible for the use of the Confidential Information by its Representatives and, in the event of discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure, must promptly notify the other party. A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law; but only after it provides the other party reasonable notice (if legally permissible) to enable the other party to seek a protective order or other appropriate relief before any Confidential Information is disclosed. Microsoft reserves all rights under the Freedom of Information Act (“**FOIA**”), 5 U.S.C. § 552 or other comparable law to object to requests for disclosure of Microsoft’s Confidential Information.  

Neither party is required to restrict work assignments of its Representatives who have had access to Confidential Information. The parties acknowledge and agree that neither party can control information the other party may disclose in the course of working together, or what each party’s respective Representatives may remember, even without notes or other aids. Each party agrees that the use of information retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’ respective products or services does not create liability under these Terms or trade secret law, and each party agrees to limit what it discloses to the other accordingly.

Except as permitted above, neither party will use or disclose the other’s party Confidential Information for five years after it is received. The five-year time period does not apply if applicable law requires a longer period.

You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the Software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit [https://aka.ms/exporting](https://aka.ms/exporting).

By accessing the Software, you acknowledge the Software is made available for presentation and demonstration purposes only, and that any use in a live environment is at your sole risk. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the Software. You are solely responsible for ensuring the regulatory, legal, and contractual compliance of any use of the Software, including obtaining any authorizations or consents, and any solution you or your end users choose to build that incorporates the Software in whole or in part.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. MICROSOFT WILL NOT BE PROVIDING ANY TECHNICAL OR OTHER SUPPORT IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE. IN NO EVENT SHALL MICROSOFT OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

The above limitation applies to (i) anything related to the Software, services, content (including code) on third-party Internet sites or in third-party applications; and (ii) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law. The above limitation also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages. This clause shall not impair the U.S. Government’s right to recover for fraud or crimes arising out of or related to these Terms under any federal fraud statute, including the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733.

Washington state law governs the interpretation of these Terms, without regard to its conflicts of law principles, except that (i) if you are a U.S. federal government entity, these Terms are governed by the federal laws of the United States; and (ii) if you are a U.S. state or local government entity, these Terms are governed by the laws of your state. With respect to any disputes arising under these Terms, (x) if federal jurisdiction exists, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts in King County, Washington; and (y) if federal jurisdiction does not exist, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington. To the extent you are a U.S. federal government entity, any disputes arising out of these Terms shall be handled in accordance with the Contracts Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. §§ 7101-7109).  

To the extent you are a U.S. federal government entity, if any document incorporated by reference into these Terms contains a provision (a) allowing for the automatic termination of your license rights; (b) allowing for the automatic renewal of services and/or fees; (c) requiring the governing law to be anything other than federal law; and/or (d) that otherwise violates applicable U.S. federal law, then such terms will not apply to you.  If any document incorporated by reference into these Terms contains an indemnification provision, such provision shall not apply as to the U.S. federal government indemnifying Microsoft or any other party.

Any cost or pricing data provided by Microsoft related to the Software will be for exemplary purposes only, be non-binding and will not constitute an offer.

Either party may terminate these Terms for convenience upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other party. Microsoft may terminate these Terms upon notice to you if you materially breach these Terms, which includes but is not limited to using the Software in a manner that is not expressly authorized under these Terms. The representations and warranties, limitation of liability, governing law, and confidentiality provisions in these Terms will survive termination of these Terms.

**Public sector acknowledgements**. It is the intent of Microsoft that these Terms be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. To the extent you are a U.S. government or other public sector entity, Microsoft enters into these Terms without seeking promises or favoritism for Microsoft in any future engagements, including any solicitations or contracts with you or your contractors. Microsoft is entering these Terms with the understanding that it will not, as a result of these Terms, be prohibited from any procurement opportunities or be subject to any reporting requirements. Any technical services or resources related to the Software provided by Microsoft within the scope of these Terms are being offered with no expectation of payment; it is Microsoft’s intent that any such technical services or resources under these Terms be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations with respect to gratuitous services.  It is specifically understood that all services and resources provided are for your sole benefit and use and are not provided to or for the benefit of any individual government employee. If required by law, an ethics officer of your organization will sign a letter acknowledging the foregoing.
